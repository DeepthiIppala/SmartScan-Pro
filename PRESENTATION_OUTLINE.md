# SmartScan Pro - Business Proposition
## Presentation Outline for Mid-Term

---

### **Slide 1: Title Slide**
**SmartScan Pro**
*AI-Powered Self-Checkout for Marshall's Stores*

**Tagline:** "Scan, Pay, Go - No Lines, No Wait"

**Your Name**
**Course & Professor**
**October 26, 2025**

---

### **Slide 2: The Problem** 🚨

**Marshall's Checkout Pain Points:**

❌ **Long checkout lines** during peak hours
❌ **Average wait time:** 5-10 minutes per customer
❌ **Customer frustration** leads to cart abandonment
❌ **Staffing challenges** - limited cashiers available
❌ **Lost sales** - customers leave without buying

**Statistics:**
- 60% of shoppers abandon purchases due to long lines
- Average store loses $50,000/year from cart abandonment
- Peak times (weekends, holidays) = 15+ minute waits

---

### **Slide 3: The Solution** ✨

**SmartScan Pro: Self-Checkout Mobile App**

**What It Does:**
- Customers use their phone to scan items while shopping
- Pay instantly via Stripe (credit/debit card)
- Show QR code Exit Pass to security
- Leave store immediately - NO CASHIER NEEDED

**Result:** Checkout time reduced from **5-10 minutes → 30 seconds**

---

### **Slide 4: How It Works (In-Store Flow)** 📱

```
1. ENTER STORE
   ↓ Customer opens SmartScan Pro app

2. SHOP & SCAN
   ↓ Scan barcodes OR use AI to identify products
   ↓ Items automatically added to cart

3. CHECKOUT
   ↓ Click "Proceed to Checkout"
   ↓ Pay with credit card (Stripe)
   ↓ Payment processed instantly

4. EXIT VERIFICATION
   ↓ App generates QR code "Exit Pass"
   ↓ Show QR to security at exit
   ↓ Security scans QR → verifies purchase

5. LEAVE STORE ✓
   ↓ Customer walks out with items
```

**Key Difference from Online Shopping:**
- This is IN-PERSON shopping with instant mobile checkout
- No waiting for shipping - take items home today
- No cashier interaction needed

---

### **Slide 5: AI-Powered Unique Features** 🤖

**What Makes Us Different:**

### **1. AI Product Recognition** 🔍
- **Problem:** Not all items have barcodes (clothing, produce)
- **Solution:** Upload photo → AI identifies product
- **Example:** Take picture of cardigan → AI matches to "Women's Cardigan $29.99"

### **2. AI Visual Search** 📸
- **Problem:** Customer sees outfit on Instagram, can't find it
- **Solution:** Upload ANY photo → AI finds similar items at Marshall's
- **Example:** Upload Pinterest photo → Find 5 similar cardigans in stock

### **3. AI Smart Recommendations** 💡
- **Problem:** Customers miss complementary products
- **Solution:** AI suggests matching items based on cart
- **Example:** Cart has cardigan → AI suggests scarves, belts, jewelry

### **4. AI Shopping Assistant** 💬
- **Problem:** No staff available to help
- **Solution:** Chat with AI about products, prices, deals
- **Example:** "Where can I find yoga pants?" → AI guides customer

**Competitor Apps:** Just scan barcodes
**SmartScan Pro:** AI understands context, visual search, personalized help

---

### **Slide 6: Technology Stack** 💻

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 15 (React)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Responsive mobile-first design

**Backend:**
- Python Flask
- SQLAlchemy (Database ORM)
- JWT Authentication
- RESTful API

**Database:**
- SQLite with 95 real Marshall's products
- Categories: Clothing, Footwear, Handbags, Kitchen, Home, Grocery

**AI & Services:**
- Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (product recognition, visual search)
- Stripe Payment Processing (production-ready)
- QR Code generation (Exit Pass)

---

### **Slide 7: Security & Anti-Fraud** 🔒

**How We Prevent Theft:**

### **Exit Pass Verification**
- QR code contains encrypted transaction data:
  - Transaction ID
  - User ID
  - Items count
  - Total amount
  - Timestamp

### **Security Check Process**
1. Customer shows QR at exit
2. Security scans with app
3. System validates:
   - ✓ Payment confirmed
   - ✓ Transaction recent (<30 min)
   - ✓ Items match receipt
4. Security approves exit

### **AI Fraud Detection** (Future)
- Behavioral analysis (scan speed, patterns)
- Detect if user scans 5 items but pays for 2
- Flag suspicious transactions for review

**Note:** Physical items still in shopping bag - visual verification possible

---
