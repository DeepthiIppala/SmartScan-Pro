## üöÄ Future Roadmap (Sprints)
*Each sprint is 2 weeks.*

### Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation & Setup
- [ ] Initialize Git repository.
- [ ] Set up the front-end (React) and back-end (Flask) project structures.
- [ ] Design the database schema for Users, Products, and Carts.
- [ ] Create basic UI mockups and wireframes.

### Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): User Authentication
- [ ] Implement user registration and login functionality on the back end.
- [ ] Create sign-up and login pages on the front end.
- [ ] Implement JWT token-based authentication to secure endpoints.

### Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6): Core Scanning & Cart Feature
- [ ] Integrate a barcode scanning library into the React front end.
- [ ] Create back-end endpoints to fetch product details based on a scanned barcode.
- [ ] Implement the real-time shopping cart on the front end.

### Sprint 4 (Weeks 7-8): Checkout & Finalization
- [ ] Develop the checkout process logic.
- [ ] Generate a QR code receipt after successful "payment".
- [ ] Create a "verification" screen for the cashier.
- [ ] Refine the UI and fix bugs.

### Future Sprints (Post-MVP)
- **AI Object Recognition:** Implement a feature to identify items without barcodes (like produce) using a machine learning model (e.g., TensorFlow.js).
- **Promotions Engine:** Add functionality to apply discounts and coupons.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Create a simple dashboard for retailers to view sales data.
